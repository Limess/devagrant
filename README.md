devagrant
=========

Vagrant configuration using Puppet and the fantastic r10k for multi-project use.

This module is intended (when complete...) to be used as a git submodule in other projects, allowing the user to override:
site.pp
Puppetfile and
vagrant.yaml
to match their needs, using whatever modules they like.

This project requires the vagrant-r10k plugin.
